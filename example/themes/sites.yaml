sites:

  - key:     MySite
    # Replace the key with the name of your site. If you do not use a "resolve"
    # entry, this will be part of your site's URL.

    theme:   Main
    # The theme key must match the "key" entry of a "theme.yaml" file.

    resolve: {}
    # An empty "resolve" object is suitable for a server that hosts only one
    # site. The site will be served from the root of your servlet path. Delete
    # the "resolve" entry to use the site key as part of the URL by default.
