## What is Ambra?

Ambra is an innovative Open Source platform for publishing [Open Access][oa]
research articles. It provides features for post-publication discussion and
versioned articles that allows for a "living" document around which further
scientific discoveries can be made. The platform is in active development by
[PLOS (Public Library of Science)][plos] and is licensed under the [MIT
License][mit].
